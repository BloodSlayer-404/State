### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "State" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
This example is based on the transformation of the player in different creatures with different abilities in the videogame Genshin Impact.

In this case, the Player has some specific methods (like attack, jump or use it elemental skill), that will change depending the corresponding state in which it will be.

This specific implementations will change depending on the state, for example, if the player is in the Traveller form, it will attack using a sword, but if it is transformed into a fat monster, he will attack doing belly flops.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/State/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/State/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
